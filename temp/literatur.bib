  abstract  = {Service Workers are indeed powerful, and the Angular Service Worker is no exception. They do complex and advanced jobs for building a web application. However, based on my experience building PWAs over the years, things are not always going in a way that we like. It may happen that the Service Worker acts in unforeseen ways, and it may interrupt the user experience or even make our app completely useless and unreachable.},

  abstract  = {There are common scenarios in which web applications are limited by not having an open tab in a browser. However, if we take our app to the mobile world, this limitation does not exists, because even though a mobile app is closed, we can interact with the user by using, for example, push notifications. Service workers are the best option for adding special capabilities to web apps, which make them feel natural when they are installed from a mobile device (without users having to ``enter'' an app store or Google Play).},

If you need to make an API call while you don't have a connection, there's no mechanism in place to do that. This Pirate app is so great, we'd love for people to be able to leave comments about it. Or even have pirate-based conversations! But what if you happen to like posting Internet comments when you're out at sea where your Internet connection is choppy?

  abstract = {The developers use the cross-platform mobile development solutions to develop the mobile application once and run it on many platforms. Many of these cross-platform solutions are still under research and development. Also, these solutions are based on different approaches such as Cross-Compilation approach, Virtual Machine approach, and Web-Based approach. There are many survey papers about the cross-platform mobile development solutions but they do not include the most recent approaches, including Component-Based approach, Cloud-Based approach, and Merged approach. The main aim of this paper is helping the researchers to know the most recent approaches and the open research issues. This paper surveys the existing cross-platform mobile development approaches and attempts to provide a global view: it thoroughly introduces a comprehensive categorization to the cross-platform approaches, defines the pros and cons of each approach, explains sample solutions per approach, compares the cross-platform mobile development solutions, and ends with the open research areas.},

  abstract = {The development of software applications has now shifted from desktop to mobile devices. Mobile application developers have been facing hardware configuration and network communication constraints in native, hybrid, and mobile web-based software architecture for a long time. Progressive Web Application is new research in this direction, created in order to overcome the limitations of native, hybrid, and mobile web-based application architecture for mobile devices. The Progressive Web Application architecture consists of a single software application which runs on multiple operating systems (android, iOS, and window phones) efficiently, uses device memory, and is even accessible in the event of no internet connection. Many IT companies have reported overall improvement in their mobile application user base after switching to Progressive Web Application. The recent discussions about Progressive Web Application on the google platform predict a demanding future. Hence, this article seeks to investigate the validity of claims that the Progressive Web Application has the edge over native, hybrid, and mobile web application architecture. The study uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process for deciding which of the architecture types suites the development of a mobile application based on three established constraints. The study outcome will aid software development communities in comprehending the Progressive Web Application and motivate them to use it in the development of an optimized mobile application.},

  abstract = {Mobile app development is hindered by device fragmentation and vendor-specific modifications. Boundaries between devices blur with PC-tablet hybrids on the one side and wearables on the other. Future apps need to support a host of app-enabled devices with differing capabilities, along with their software ecosystems. Prior work on cross-platform app development concerned concepts and prototypes, and compared approaches that target smartphones. To aid choosing an appropriate framework and to support the scientific assessment of approaches, an up-to-date comparison framework is needed. Extending work on a holistic, weighted set of assessment criteria, we propose what could become the definitive framework for evaluating cross-platform approaches. We have based it on sound abstract concepts that allow extensions. The weighting capabilities offer customisation to avoid the proverbial comparison of apples and oranges lurking in the variety of available frameworks. Moreover, it advises on multiple development situations based on a single assessment. In this article, we motivate and describe our evaluation criteria. We then present a study that assesses several frameworks and compares them to Web Apps and native development. Our findings suggest that cross-platform development has seen much progress but the challenges are ever growing. Therefore, additional support for app developers is warranted.},
